# BOW_similarity_XAI
## Description
This repository contains the code associated to our paper "Bag-of-Words Similarity in eXplainable AI"
Sara Narteni, Melissa Ferretti, Vittorio Rampa, and Maurizio Mongelli. , accepted for publication in the proceedings of the Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys) 2022.

The aim is to compute the rule similarity between two rulesets, via adoption of a Bag-of-Words approach.

## Usage

Just clone the repository and run _testBow_RS.py_ 

## Datasets
We also share the original data that were used to generate the rulesets. In our case, we adopted the Logic Learning Machine model, but the BOW similarity approach can be applied to any rule-based algorithm, provided being able to express the rules in IF-THEN format.
