# BOW_similarity_XAI
## Description
This repository contains the code associated to our paper: Narteni, S., Ferretti, M., Rampa, V., Mongelli, M. (2023). Bag-of-Words Similarity in eXplainable AI. In: Arai, K. (eds) Intelligent Systems and Applications. IntelliSys 2022. Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, vol 543. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16078-3_58

The aim is to compute the rule similarity between two rulesets, via adoption of an innovative approach based on the Bag-of-Words concept.

## Usage

Just clone the repository and run _testBow_RS.py_ 

## Datasets
We also share the original data that were used to generate the rulesets. In our case, we adopted the Logic Learning Machine model, but the BOW similarity approach can be applied to any rule-based algorithm, provided being able to express the rules in IF-THEN format.
